# First Backend Assignment

## Project Overview

This project is a backend assignment designed to demonstrate proficiency in core Node.Js modules covering modules like Path, File System, Http and Process module.


## #1 Assignment

Covers basic routing and rendering of HTML file. The task is to return the student basic data in a simple webpage if the url is `/index.html` and return a `404` page if the request `url` does not match.

## #2 Assignment

Covers extended routing that makes use of the following request method `GET` `POST` `PUT` `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

The task is to manage an inventory of items with `Node.Js` by being able to read, create, edit and delete an item from the inventory.

The inventory items will be managed with a `JSON` file and not a `Database`.

The codebase of this solution is expected to be `Modular in nature`, `Consistent in data structure being returned` and `handle error effectively`

## Usage
## First Assignment

1. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd first_assignment
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```
3. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Second Assignment

1. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd second_assignment
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run server
    ```
3. Access the API at `http://localhost:8080`.

## PS
In case PORT `8080` is in use in your local computer, custom `PORT` Number can be used to run the server.

```bash
npm run server {PORT}
```
replace `{PORT}` with your custom PORT Number and the server will be ready.

```bash
npm run server 3000
